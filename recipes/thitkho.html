    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs of pork belly or pork shoulder, sliced into 1 inch pieces</li>
        <li>6-12 eggs, hard-boiled and peeled</li>
        <li>⅓ cup of fish sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of sugar + ½ teaspoon of sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of minced garlic</li>
        <li>¼ cup of minced shallots</li>
        <li>1 can of coconut soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of chicken bullion powder (optional)</li>
        <li>3 cups of water</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice pork into 1 inch or slightly smaller cubes.</li>
        <li>In a large pot, make the nuoc mau (caramel sauce) by heating 1 tablespoon of oil and 1 tablespoon of sugar on medium heat until it starts to caramelize. It will darken from clear to amber. Lower heat and continue to simmer until it reaches a dark caramel color. Be very careful not to burn! Any darker and the caramel sauce will be bitter — it should be discarded and made again.</li>
        <li>Add garlic and shallots to the pot and cook for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Bring the heat up to medium high and stir in the pork to coat it in the caramel sauce.</li>
        <li>Add fish sauce and stir until the pork is browned on all sides.</li>
        <li>Add coconut soda and water and bring to a boil. Skim off any foam and scum and discard, then lower to simmer.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs, remaining sugar, and chicken bullion powder. Cover the pot with a lid slightly askew and simmer until the pork is tender (60-90 minutes).</li>
      </ol>
